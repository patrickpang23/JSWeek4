// MEDIUM: Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand. (i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]).
// You are given a target value to search. If found in the array return its index, otherwise return -1.
// You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.
// Hint:  Use a function. Use the built in method .indexOf( ) and/or  for loops. Review your lesson on Arrays to aid in working through this problem. 
// Example 1:
// Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
// Output: 4
// Example 2:
// Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
// Output: -1.

const nums = [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2]

const ifFound = (arr, target) => {
    if (arr.indexOf(target)); {
        return arr.indexOf(target)
    }
}

console.log(ifFound(nums, 3));
